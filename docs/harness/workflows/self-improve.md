# Self-Improve Workflow

## Purpose

Turn verified delivery evidence into small, human-approved improvements to the
harness knowledge base and working method. Rule promotion is one possible
outcome; it is not the entire workflow.

## Use When

Use after a Delivery Report or Decision identifies friction, stale guidance,
missing validation, repeated mistakes, or a useful pattern that may improve a
Spec, template, workflow, project policy, or promoted Rule.

## Inputs

- Completed Delivery Reports (`REP-XXX`) and approved Decisions (`DEC-XXX`).
- Their verification evidence, plan variance, friction notes, and optional
  `recurrence_key` values.
- Current Specs, templates, workflows, `RULES.md`, and promoted `RULE-XXX`
  artifacts.
- Wikilinks and index relationships; optional derived Graphify output.

## Hard Gates

- **Evidence Gate:** Every proposed improvement must cite direct evidence. An
  agent opinion or confidence statement is not evidence.
- **Classification Gate:** Classify the signal before changing anything:
  isolated incident, documentation drift, workflow/template friction, missing
  validation, durable decision, or recurring rule candidate.
- **Human Approval Gate:** A human must approve the target, scope, and wording
  before any canonical policy, workflow, template, Spec, or Rule changes.
- **Recurrence Gate for Rules:** Promoting `RULE-XXX` requires at least two
  independent Reports or Decisions with the same stable `recurrence_key` and a
  shared reusable lesson.
- **No Recursive Automation Gate:** The CLI may list candidates and validate
  approved edits, but it must never rewrite its own rules or workflows
  automatically.

## Procedure

1. **Capture the Signal:** Record the observed friction, consequence, evidence,
   and suggested follow-up in the originating Report or Decision. Add a stable
   `recurrence_key` only when future occurrences should be grouped.
2. **Classify the Signal:** Route it to the smallest suitable outcome:
   - isolated defect or task-specific issue → keep it in the Report or create
     follow-up work; do not create a general rule;
   - stale technical truth → propose a focused Spec correction;
   - unclear authoring structure → propose a template correction;
   - repeated process friction → propose a workflow improvement;
   - durable trade-off → interrupt with the Decision Workflow and return to the
     Self Improve proposal after resolution;
   - repeated reusable lesson → evaluate a promoted Rule.
3. **Search Existing Guidance:** Check Specs, Decisions, workflows, templates,
   `RULES.md`, and promoted Rules for an existing answer. Prefer correcting or
   superseding existing guidance over creating duplicates.
4. **Aggregate Recurrence:** For a rule candidate, locate at least two
   independent sources with the same `recurrence_key`. Confirm they represent
   separate occurrences and the same underlying lesson.
5. **Draft the Smallest Improvement:** State the target file, exact change,
   expected benefit, evidence links, possible side effects, and verification
   method. Use 2–3 alternatives when the improvement has a meaningful
   trade-off; list the simplest viable option first.
6. **Request Approval:** Present the proposal to the human. Do not mutate a
   canonical document before approval.
7. **Apply the Approved Change:** Make only the approved edit:
   - Spec, template, or workflow improvement → update the canonical file and
     preserve its established contract;
   - project policy improvement → update `RULES.md` while retaining stable
     `R-XXX` labels;
   - promoted rule → allocate the next monotonic `RULE-XXX`, copy
     `templates/rule.md`, link the evidence, and supersede conflicting rules
     rather than rewriting history.
8. **Verify:** Run relevant schema, link, snapshot, workflow, and test checks.
   Confirm the change introduces no broken references or contradictory
   guidance.
9. **Close the Loop:** Record the accepted improvement and verification result
   in a Report or Decision. Rebuild the derived index through tooling when that
   capability exists.
10. **Visualize Relationships (Optional):** Graphify may help inspect related
    evidence. If missing, warn and skip. Obtain explicit permission before any
    configuration that sends documents or images to an external provider, and
    treat all Graphify output as removable derived state.

## Output

Exactly one of these evidence-backed outcomes:

- no change, with the reason recorded;
- a retained candidate awaiting more evidence;
- an approved update to a Spec, template, workflow, or `RULES.md`;
- an approved Decision; or
- an active Rule artifact (resolved from the configuration, by default `docs/harness/rules/RULE-XXX-kebab-name.md`) linked to at least two
  independent occurrences.

## Completion Criteria

- The signal is classified and linked to its source evidence.
- The human approved every canonical change.
- The applied change is the smallest one that addresses the evidence.
- Rule promotion, when selected, has two independent recurrence sources and
  matching filename/frontmatter ID.
- Relevant validation and tests pass, with results recorded.
- No duplicate, broken link, contradictory guidance, hidden trace state, or
  unapproved external data transfer was introduced.

## Prohibited Actions

- Do not automatically rewrite rules, workflows, templates, or Specs.
- Do not promote a Rule from one occurrence, one incident split across multiple
  files, or unsupported opinion.
- Do not use Self-Improve to bypass the Feature, Decision, Plan, or Cook gates.
- Do not store learning in a database, hidden trace ledger, chat transcript, or
  Graphify output.
- Do not make unrelated cleanup changes while applying an approved improvement.

## Failure and Recovery

- **Insufficient Evidence:** Keep the candidate in its Report or Decision and
  wait for independent evidence; do not promote it.
- **Conflicting Guidance:** Pause and use the Decision Workflow to choose which
  contract should govern, then supersede the losing guidance explicitly.
- **Verification Failure:** Leave the improvement unaccepted, fix or revert
  only the authorized edit without discarding user changes, and rerun checks.
- **Graphify Unavailable:** Warn and continue using canonical wikilinks and
  index checks.
- **Handoff Boundary:** The workflow ends after the improvement is approved,
  verified, and recorded. A resulting product behavior change starts Feature;
  maintenance inside existing authority starts Plan; a durable policy choice
  interrupts through Decision and then returns to the appropriate boundary.
